    We now care about the version of nspawn we are running.  The output of
    systemd-nspawn --version looks like:

    ```
    systemd 242 (v242-2.fb1)
    +PAM +AUDIT +SELINUX +IMA ...
    ```
    So we can get the major version as the second token of the first line.
    We hope that the output of systemd-nspawn --version is stable enough
    to keep parsing it like this.
