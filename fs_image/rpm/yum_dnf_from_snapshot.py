This tool wraps `yum` and its successor `dnf`, with two changes to ensure
more hermetic behavior:

  - The `{yum,dnf}.conf`, the repo metadata, and the RPM contents are all
    served out of a directory produced `snapshot-repos`, **not** against
    some kind of live, external RPM repo collection.  So if both the
    snapshot, and `fs_images/rpm` are committed to the same version control,
    then a single version ID completely determines the outcome of a package
    manager invocation.

  - The `yum` or `dnf` invocation runs in a Linux namespaces sandbox with an
    isolated network, and with some additional bind mounts that are intended
    to prevent it from accessing host configuration, state, or caches.

Put in other words, we first configure `yum` or `dnf` to act in a
deterministic fashion, and later execute it in a sandbox to prevent its
non-isolatable features from behaving non-determinitically.

Note that `dnf` support was "bolted on" to this tool, and may be less
mature.  However, the isolation features are no longer very important, since
we now do all RPM installs from a "build appliance", so this code-path will
be significantly simplified soon.

Sample usage:

    buck run TARGET_PATH:yum-dnf-from-snapshot -- \\
        --storage '{"key": "SOME_KEY", "kind": "SOME_KIND", ...}' \\
        --snapshot-dir REPOS_PATH --install-root TARGET_DIR -- \\
            dnf install --assumeyes some-package-name

Note that we have TWO `--` arguments, with the first protecting the
wrapper's arguments from `buck`, and the second protecting `yum` or `dnf`'s
arguments from the wrapper.

It should be safe to `--assumeyes` (which auto-imports GPG keys), because:
  - The snapshot repo server runs on localhost and only listens inside an
    ephemeral private network namespace, making compromise unlikely.
  - The repo server verifies RPM & repodata checksums against the
    version-controlled snapshot before sending them out.
  - Snapshotted repos are required to have `gpgcheck` enabled. When
    `snapshot-repos` downloads GPG keys, it checks them against a
    predetermined whitelist, protecting us against transient key injections.
    Many other sanity checks happen at snapshot time.

This binary normally runs inside a build appliance (see `RpmActionItem`).
The code here thus uses the BA's `yum` or `dnf` binary, so build appliance
upgrades can break this code.

## Future work

The current tool works well, with these caveats:

  - `yum` & `dnf` leaves various caches inside `--install-root`, which bloat
    the image.  `RpmActionItem` has a bind-mount to prevent this leakage,
    and we also provide `//fs_image/features:rpm_cleanup` which should be
    included in all production layers.

  - Base CentOS packages deposit a vanilla CentOS `yum` configuration into
    the install root via `/etc/yum.repos.d/`, bearing no relation to the
    `yum.conf` that was used to install packages into the image.  Note that
    `dnf` would try to look in the same `yum.repos.d` if we did not hide it.

  - This is significantly slower than vanilla `yum/dnf`.  On an SSD host, a
    vanilla `yum install net-tools` takes about 1:00, while the current
    `yum-dnf-from-snapshot` needs 3:40.  The two major reasons are:

      * `repo-server` could be faster, specifically it (i) should support
        serving multiple files in parallel, (ii) the Facebook-production
        blob store has some notes on how to eliminate the ~1 second-per-blob
        fetch latency at the expense of 1-2 days of work, (iii) some caching
        of blobs may help, (iv) `repo_server.py` can start faster if
        it avoids eagerly loading the `rpm` table into RAM.

      * Since we typically run `yum/dnf` in an empty clean install-root, the
        initial run can be extra-slow due to having to download the repodata,
        and build the local DB / populate local caches.  However, the
        `RpmActionItem` "build appliance" normally mitigates this by
        providing warm caches for the repo snapshot.

  - This brings up and tears down network namespaces frequently. According
    to ast@kernel.org, bugs are routinely introduced that break NETNS
    clean-up, which may cause us to leak namespaces in production. If this
    becomes an issue, we can try cgroup-bpf style firewalling instead,
    along the lines of the program in `bind4_prog_load` in the kernel's
    `test_sock_addr.c`.

  - When installing into a blank root, `yum/dnf` cannot discover the
    release, so it literally has `/repos/x86_64/$releasever` as the
    'persistdir' subdirectory.  How should we determine the correct release
    for a snapshot-based install?  Fake it?  Add `/etc/*-release` from the
    snapshot host to the snapshot?

We're on the verge of shipping the easy fix of parallelizing `repo-server`
very soon, but other perf improvements will be wanted.
