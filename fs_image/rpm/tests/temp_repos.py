# The `rpm` module is concerned with recording the evolution of a set of
# RPM repos over time. Therefore, a generic input to achieve good test
# coverage should:
#  - provide a repo history with several time-steps,
#  - contain potentially related RPM repos that change between time-steps,
#  - contain different packages, and varying versions of the same package,
#  - have packages that occur in the same or different versions across repos.
#
# This `SAMPLE_STEPS` attempts to provide such a history without making
# tests excessively slow.  Feel free to revise it, as long as tests pass.
# Most tests should NOT depend on the specifics of the repo contents -- look
# for `test_post_install` for the sole exception.
#
# Below, the array index is the step number, modeling the passage of time.
#
#  - If a repo has a value of `None`, we will delete this repo, asserting
#    that it existed in the prior timestamp.
#  - If a repo value is a string, it is an alias to another existing repo,
#    which is a symlink to the original, to minimize the performance
#    overhead.  If you MUST commit a temp repo to a source control repo
#    using Buck, you may wish to set `avoid_symlinks`, since the Buck team
#    really dislikes symlinks in repos (i.e. something may break).
