For an active project, all to-do lists are instantly stale, and tend to
contain either items that are done, or items that don't **have** to get done
right away.

This section of the docs skews towards the latter kind of "to do".  It is
also definitely incomplete.

However, it is useful to have a place to write down ideas for evolving
specific subsystems, to be revisited when one **needs** to make substantial
changes in the future.  Reviewing such a "to do" list can help one
(re)understand the design decisions in a particular module, and their
downsides.

Further subpages are split by "major subsystem", which usually named after
its subdirectory in the code.
