class Unshare:
    """
    This context manager lets a non-root process run commands inside a set
    of Linux namespaces, either as root, or as the original user.

    This creates a dummy keepalive process, which owns the specified set of
    namespaces.  The keepalive exits whenever this context exits, triggering
    namespace cleanup.  The keepalive also exits whenever its stdin pipe is
    closed, which means it ought not outlive the parent.

    Our actual implementation immediately passes ownership of the namespaces
    to the current process, so for most namespaces, this class will continue
    working as intended even if the keepalive process is killed.  This, of
    course, is not true for PID namespaces -- those can only work while the
    keepalive process exists (since it is the `init` of the namespace).


    ## Gotchas of the current PID namespace implementation

    The namespace's `init` is `cat`. This causes two defects:
      - It lacks normal signal handling for `init`. This is "OK", since the
        current unprivileged process cannot signal `sudo` children anyway.
      - It does not wait for children reparented to it. The resulting
        zombies could be a cosmetic problem if a substantial number of
        children are started via `nsenter_*` commands.

    Besides the bad `init`, we also fail to mount a new `/proc` inside the
    PID namespace, so programs like `ps` will be broken under `nsenter_*`
    commands.

    The ONLY intention of this broken PID namespace implementation is to
    make the calling process less likely to leak `sudo` its descendants, and
    it succeeds at that.  But it is not a proper container system.


    ## Design notes / future work

    Future: An `Unshare` object could easily support running `unshare` after
    `nsenter`ing into another `Unshare` -- a form of nesting.

    Future: The `nsenter_*` calls could support entering
    a subset of the unshared namespaces.

    NB: The `run_as_user` functionality exists to annotate whether the end
    logic requires privileges or not.  The specific implementation of
    setting to the original effective UID/GID after `nsenter` definitely
    does not restore the SAME authentication context that the parent has --
    it's just an approximation (e.g. supplementary groups are dropped).
