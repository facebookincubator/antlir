# This comprises a pure python implementation of rpm version comparison. The
# purpose for this is so that the antlir library does not have a dependency
# on a C library that is (for the most part) only distributed as part of rpm
# based distros. Depending on a C library complicates dependency management
# significantly in the OSS space due to the complexity of handling 3rd party C
# libraries with buck. Having this pure python implementation also eases future
# rpm usage/handling for both non-rpm based distros and different arch types.
#
# This implementation is adapted from both this blog post:
#  https://blog.jasonantman.com/2014/07/how-yum-and-rpm-compare-versions/
# and this Apache 2 licensed implementation:
#   https://github.com/sassoftware/python-rpm-vercmp/blob/master/rpm_vercmp/vercmp.py
#
# There are extensive test cases in the `test_rpm_metadata.py` test case that
# cover a wide variety of normal and weird version comparsions.
