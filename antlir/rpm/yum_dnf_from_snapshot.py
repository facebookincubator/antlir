This tool wraps `yum` and its successor `dnf` to ensure more hermetic
behavior.

  - This code should only ever be executed in a no-network
    `nspawn_in_subvol` container, never on a bare host.

  - (Set up by `nspawn_in_subvol/plugins/repo_servers.py`): All RPM content
    is served by `repo_server.py` from an RPM repo snapshot captured by
    `snapshot_repos.py`, built via the `rpm_repo_snapshot()` Buck macro, and
    installed into some `image.layer` via the image feature named
    `install_rpm_repo_snapshot()`.

    Besides RPM repo data, the snapshot includes the `yum-dnf-from-snapshot`
    binary, a configuration file pointed at the appropriate repo-servers,
    and a warm cache for the package manager generated using the included
    repo snapshot.

    The intent is for both `antlir/` and the RPM snapshot to be committed
    to the source control repo, so that the source control repo revision
    hash completely determines the outcome of a package manager invocation.

  - `yum` or `dnf` run inside a mount namespace, with many of the files and
    directories that they might access on the host `image.layer` replaced by
    bind-mounts (the `--protected-path` option).

In other words, this provides additional sandboxing around RPM installation
in addition to the sandbox already provided by `nspawn_in_subvol`.

Sample usage:

    buck run TARGET_PATH:yum-dnf-from-snapshot -- --snapshot-dir REPOS_PATH \\
        dnf -- --installroot TARGET_DIR install --assumeyes some-package-name

Note that we have TWO `--` arguments, with the first protecting the
wrapper's arguments from `buck`, and the second protecting `yum` or `dnf`'s
arguments from the wrapper.

It should be safe to `--assumeyes` (which auto-imports GPG keys), because:
  - The snapshot repo server runs on localhost and only listens inside an
    ephemeral private network namespace, making compromise unlikely.
  - The repo server verifies RPM & repodata checksums against the
    version-controlled snapshot before sending them out.
  - Snapshotted repos are required to have `gpgcheck` enabled. When
    `snapshot-repos` downloads GPG keys, it checks them against a
    predetermined allowlist, protecting us against transient key injections.
    Many other sanity checks happen at snapshot time.

This binary normally runs inside a build appliance (see `RpmActionItem`).
The code here thus uses the BA's `yum` or `dnf` binary, so build appliance
upgrades can break this code.

## Future work

The current tool works well, with these caveats:

  - `yum` & `dnf` leave various caches inside `--installroot`, which bloat
    the image.  `RpmActionItem` has a bind-mount to prevent this leakage,
    and we also provide `//antlir/features:rpm_cleanup` which should be
    included in all production layers.

  - Base CentOS packages deposit a vanilla CentOS `yum` configuration into
    the install root via `/etc/yum.repos.d/`, bearing no relation to the
    `yum.conf` that was used to install packages into the image.  Note that
    `dnf` would try to look in the same `yum.repos.d` if we did not hide it.

  - `nspawn_in_subvol` brings up and tears down network namespaces
    frequently.  According to ast@kernel.org, bugs are routinely introduced
    that break NETNS clean-up, which may cause us to leak namespaces in
    production.  If this becomes an issue, we can try cgroup-bpf style
    firewalling instead, along the lines of the program in `bind4_prog_load`
    in the kernel's `test_sock_addr.c`.

  - When installing into a blank root, `yum/dnf` cannot discover the
    release, so it literally has `/repos/x86_64/$releasever` as the
    'persistdir' subdirectory.  How should we determine the correct release
    for a snapshot-based install?  Fake it?  Add `/etc/*-release` from the
    snapshot host to the snapshot?

# Yum is incorrigible -- it is impossible to give it a set of options
# that will completely prevent it from accessing host configuration &
# caches.  So instead, we do this to avoid littering inside the
# surrounding `nspawn_in_subvol` container:
#
#  - `YumDnfConfIsolator` coerces the config to "isolated" or "default",
#    as much as possible.
#
#  - In our mount namespace, we bind-mount no-op files and directories
#    on top of all the configuration paths that `yum` might try to
#    access on the host (whether it does or not).  The sources for this
#    information are (i) `man yum.conf`, (ii) `man rpm`, and (iii)
#    adding `strace -ff -e trace=file -oyumtrace` below.  To check the
#    isolation, one may grep for "/(etc|var)" in the traces, keeping in
#    mind that many of the accesses happen in chroots.  E.g.
#
#      grep '(".*"' yumtrace.* | cut -f 2 -d\\" |
#        grep -v '/tmp/tmp[^/]*install/' | sort -u | less -N
#
#    Note that once `yum` starts chrooting into the install root, one
#    has to do a bit of work to filter out the chrooted actions.  It's
#    not too painful to cut out the bulk of them so manually with an
#    editor, after verifying thus that all the chrooted accesses come in
#    one continuous block:
#
#      grep -v '^[abd-z][a-z]*("/\\+tmp/tmp9q0y0pshinstall' \
#        yumtrace.3803399 |
#        egrep -v '"(/proc/self/loginuid|/var/tmp|/sys/)' |
#        egrep -v '"(/etc/selinux|/etc/localtime|/")' |
#        python3 -c 'import sys;print(sys.stdin.read(
#        ).replace(
#        "chroot(\\".\\")                             = 0\\n" +
#        "chroot(\\"/tmp/tmp9q0y0pshinstall/\\")      = 0\\n",
#        ""
#        ))'| less -N
#
#    Even though that still leaves some child processes that ran
#    entirely inside a chroot, the post-edit file list was still
#    possible to vet by hand, since the bulk of accesses fell into
#    /lib*, /opt, /sbin, and /usr.
#
#    NB: I kept access to:
#     /usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc /usr/lib/rpm/redhat/rpmrc
#     /usr/lib/rpm/macros /usr/lib/rpm/redhat/macros
#   on the premise that unlike the local customizations, these may be
#   required for `rpm` to function.

    #   - ephemeral copy of the snapshot cache: `/cache_name`

    # First, we never want to try to do a reflink copy from the snapshot
    # cache to the install root, because that can be a bind mount (e.g. in

    # prevent accidental changes to `/__antlir__`.  However, this breaks

    # container root.

    # To fix the second issue, we run our reflink copy in a mount namespace,
    # and (transiently) re-purpose `/cache_name` to bind-mount `/`. This has
    # the effect of stripping away the `__antlir__` bind-mount, and letting
    # us do the reflink on the root FS.
