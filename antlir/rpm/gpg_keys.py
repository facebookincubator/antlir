yum.conf files may specify `gpgkey` URLs for each repo. Here, we snapshot
the URLs used by a specific repo -- and verify that they already occur in a
previously version-controlled allowlist directory of GPG keys.  The intent
behind this secondary verification is to avoid blindly trusting the servers
(and transport layer) we use during the snapshot.
