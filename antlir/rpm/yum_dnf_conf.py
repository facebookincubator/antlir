Since `yum` and `dnf` configs are extremely similar in core syntax and
function, we use the same code to handle both.

Support for `dnf` config isolation is less complete, since we made no
systematic effort to find ways in which `dnf` affects the host system.  The
reason for this was that from now on, both package managers are always
expected to run in read-only or ephemeral build appliance images, never on
an actual host.

    The functions in this class ATTEMPT to edit `{yum,dnf}.conf` in such a
    way that the package manager will:
      - never interact with state, caches, or configuration from the host
        filesystem,
      - never interact with servers outside of the ones we specify.

    As per the file-docblock note, `dnf` isolation is likely incomplete.

    IMPORTANT: With `yum`, it is actually impossible to configure it such
    that it does not touch the host filesystem.  A couple of specific
    examples:

    (1) Regardless of the configuration, `yum` will look in
        `$host_root/$cachedir` BEFORE `$installroot/$cachedir`, which is
        breaks isolation of RPM content and repodata.

    (2) Regardless of the configuration, `yum` will attempt to read
        `/etc/yum/vars` from the host, breaking isolation of configuration.

    There are other examples. To see the bind-mount protections we use to
    avoid leakage from the host, read `_isolate_yum_dnf_and_wait_until_ready` --
    and of course, the larger purpose of `yum-dnf-from-snapshot` is to run
    its `yum` or `dnf` inside a private network namespace to guarantee no
    off-host repo accesses.
