    Epoch and name can be `None` to represent wildcards (details below).

    The intended application of the sort is for diff-stable serialization of
    ENVRA IDs, so it does NOT do what you expect. Namely, it will sort:
      - packages with different names or architectures,
      - sort unknown (`None`) `.epoch` and `.name` values, so long as we're
        not comparing `None` with non-`None`.

    If you want plain `rpm`-compatible comparison of versions, just call
    `compare_rpm_versions(a.as_rpm_metadata(), b.as_rpm_metadata())`.
