# `pathlib` refuses to operate on `bytes`, which is the only sane way on Linux.
class Path(bytes):
    """
    A `bytes` path that supports joining via the / operator.

    `Path` can mostly be used in place of `bytes`, with a few key differences:
      - It is an error to compare it to `str`, preventing a common bug.
      - It formats as a surrogate-escaped string, not as a quoted
        byte-string.  If you need the latter, use `repr()`.

    Most operations (including construction, and `/`) accept `str` and
    `bytes`.

    We always interconvert with `str` as if the ambient encoding is `utf-8`.
    No provisions are made for other encodings, but if a use-case arose,
    this could be improved.

    `Path` exposes many helper methods borrowed from `os` and `os.path`, and
    a some `pathlib`-style methods (`read_text`, `touch`).

    Additionally, it has integration with these commonly used tools:
      - `argparse`: `from_argparse` and `parse_args`
      - `json`: `json_load` and `json_loads`
      - `Optional[Path]`: `or_none`
      - `urllib`: `file_url`

        Returns a normalized path to `path` interpreted as a child of the
        directory `self`, raising if the actual path points outside `self`.
        We check for two risks:
          - `path` is relative, and goes above `self` via '..'.
          - Some component of the path is a symlink, and this symlink, when
            interpreted by a non-chrooted tool, will attempt to access
            something outside of `self`.
        If `path` is absolute, the leading `/` is ignored.

        The above check fail on attempting to traverse an symlink within
        `self` that is an absolute path to another directory within the `self`
        -- i.e.  if you think of `self` as the root of another filesystem,
        absolute symlinks won't work.

        Such absolute symlinks are not supported by default because at
        present, I believe that the right idiom is to encourage image authors
        to manipulate the "real" locations of files, and not to manipulate
        paths through symlinks.

        In certain cases, we do want to resolve links relative to to 'self'
        (treated as an alternative root). This behavior can be enabled via the
        `resolve_links` option. If the link path can be resolved (within the
        context of the alternate root), the fully resolved (not normalized)
        path is returned. (This is done so that other callers can use the
        returned path without having to jump through special altroot path
        resolution hoops.) If the link path can't be resolved, it is returned
        as is.

        In the rare case that you need to manipulate a symlink itself (e.g.
        remove or rename), you will want to pass `no_dereference_leaf`.

        Future: consider using a file descriptor to refer to the base
        directory to better mitigate races due to renames in its path.

    2. If `overwrite` is set, then the temporary file will replace any
       file existing at `dest_path` and all of its content.

    If the with-block is exited unsuccessfully, the temporary file
    will be deleted. If the dest_path specifies a directory, it will
