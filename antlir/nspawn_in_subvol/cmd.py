    This generates the exact command used to invoke systemd-nspawn for our
    runtime experience.
    - `nspawn_subvol`: This is the actual subvol that is used for the container.
        This is need to inspect and determine if a fake /etc/os-release file is
        required to satisfy systemd-nspawn requirements.
    - `temp_cgroup`:  A unique, temporary cgroup because as of 8/2020, upstream
        `systemd-nspawn --keep-unit` runs in a hardcoded `payload`
        sub-cgroup in the current scope. The result is that when
        we run multiple `nspawn_in_subvol` tests concurrently, they
        see each other's cgroups and interfere.
        Hopefully, we can fix this upstream, but that will take a while to
        sort out, so for now, we can manage this manually.
    - `temp_bind_rootfs`:  A temporary directory that is bind mounted to
        `nspawn_subvol`.  This is necessary to prevent a mount explosion
        when `--bind-repo-ro` is used.  In that case, the repository, which
        includes the actual btrfs volume where `nspawn_subvol` exists is
        exposed to the container.  This will end up causing a mount explosion
        because all of the mounts created by nspawn (/proc, /sys, /dev, etc..)
        will end up getting recursively included.  This is undesirable, so
        this path, which is outside the repository, is used to ensure that
        the runtime mounts don't get included.
