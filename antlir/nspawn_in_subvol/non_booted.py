Read the `run.py` docblock first.  Then, review the docs for
`new_nspawn_opts` and `PopenArgs`, and use `{run,popen}_non_booted_nspawn`.

This file uses `systemd-nspawn --as-pid2` to run nspawn's internal "stub
init" as PID 1 of the container, and have that start `opts.cmd` as PID 2.

Security note: We use `--console=pipe`, which means that FDs that point at
your terminal may make it inside the container, allowing the guest to
synthesize keystrokes on the host.

        # running host's TTY/PTY (or other privileged FDs).  This is a
        # SECURITY RISK in the sense that if the container is running
        # untrusted code, it can now synthesize keystrokes on a host
        # terminal and escape.
        #
        # We leave it like this for a few reasons:
        #   - We currently only build trusted code with the toolchain.
        #     Securing it against untrusted code is a big effort, covering
        #     more than just this specific vulnerability.
        #   - Being able to use container invocations in pipelines is
        #     very useful.
        #   - In the boot case, we `nsenter`, which is subject to the
        #     same attack. We don't have code to interpose a PTY there.
        #   - If we wanted to mitigate the risk, we could later do so:
        #       * Add an `--interactive` mode that interposes a PTY, for
        #         when the user wants that.  Default to that when no command
        #         is given to the CLI, otherwise use `--non-interactive`.
        #       * In non-interactive mode, replace FDs 0/1/2 with
        #         something that interposes a pipe -- i.e. instead of
        #         `/dev/pts/0`, the container sees `[pipe]`, which
        #        is `splice`d to write to the original PTY.
        #     In fact, the mitigation really belongs in `systemd-nspawn`, we
        #     may yet propose it to upstream.
