This is intended to execute a Buck test target from inside an `image.layer`
container.

At a high level, this is very similar identical to `run.py`, so read that
file's docblock for a an introduction.  Also try `--help` for the `run-test`
binary.  You will note that some options are missing compared to `run`, and
that a couple of test-runner specific options are added.

This test wrapper expects to run a specific command, `/layer-test-binary`,
to exist inside the image, and takes the liberty of rewriting some of its
arguments, as documented in `rewrite_test_cmd`.

    The TestPilot CLI interface can have a `--output PATH` or `--list-tests`
    option, which requires us to exfiltrate data from inside the container
    to the host.

    There are a couple of complications with this:
      - The user running `buck test` will commonly be different from the
        user excuting the test inside the container, yet they need to access
        the same file.  It would not be ideal to mark the output path
        world-writable to make this work.  Nor would it be great to be doing
        a bunch of `chmod`s as `root` -- consider that it's actually not
        trivial to figure out what the UID of the requested container user
        will be.
      - Since the test runner controls the path, it's not ideal to have to
        create a matching directory hiearchy it in the container.

    To deal with these, To achieve this, the current function:
      - (partially) parses `cmd`,
      - opens PATH for writing,
      - forwards the resulting FD into the container, and injects an
        accessor for the received FD into the test's command-line.
