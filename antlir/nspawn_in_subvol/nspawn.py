Read the `run.py` docblock first.  Then, review the docs for
`new_nspawn_opts` and `PopenArgs`, and invoke `{run,popen}_nspawn`.

In this file, we first use `systemd-nspawn` to start the container's init
system (PID 1).  Then, we enter the container's cgroup, clone its
capabilities, and `nsenter` its Linux namespaces in order to execute
`opts.cmd` in the container.

The API tries to follow `subprocess.Popen` and `subprocess.run`, with a few
notable exceptions:
  - We spawn and manage two separate processes:
      * The container console process, running as a child of `systemd-nspawn`:
          - `boot=True`: the container PID 1 is `systemd`
          - `boot=False`: PID 1 is `systemd-stubinit` (`--as-pid2`), while
             our custom no-op process is PID 2.
      * The client process, injected (as above) into the container.

    For this reason, both functions return a tuple, with the first element
    for the client process, and the second element for the container console
    process.  The lifetime of the console process **should** be longer (in
    both directions) than that of the client process.

  - The console process's `stdout` (aka the boot console) and `stderr` both
    get redirected to `popen_args.console`.  This process takes no input.
    In systemd 243+, the redirecting happens via some PTYs, so you will
    likely see carriage returns in those streams.  I am not sure if there's
    a way to fix this (in `systemd` or otherwise).

  - You can configure pipes to the client process via `subprocess.PIPE`.
    However, this is **not** possible with `console`.

    The reason is simply that this not a need we currently have (outside of
    tests), and supporting it well would create considerably complexity.

    In a nutshell, from the start of the `systemd` process, until its exit,
    we have to keep `console` drained to avoid deadlocks.  To make
    this draining happen correctly, one of a few things needs to happen:

      - `console` is drained by the kernel (i.e. a file or a terminal)

      - Everything here is converted to `async` code with considerable
        attention  to detail and a considerable increase in conceptual
        complexity.

      - A separate thread or subprocess is provided to drain the read
        end of this pipe. This is what we do in `test_boot_proc_results`,
        but writing generic code for this is complex and potentially
        risky (fork / thread stuff), so it was not done yet.

        Moreover, providing built-in draining support of this sort would
        significantly increase API complexity, see P126395382 for a very raw
        preview.

SECURITY NOTE: Just as with `systemd-nspawn`'s `--console=pipe`, this can
pass FDs pointed at your terminal into the container, allowing the guest to
synthesize keystrokes on the host.
