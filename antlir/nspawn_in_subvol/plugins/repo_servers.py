Serve RPM repo snapshots inside the container by adding this to `plugins`
kwarg of the `run_*` or `popen_*` functions: `RepoServers(snapshot_paths)`

In practice, you will want `rpm_nspawn_plugins` instead.

The snapshots must already be in the container's image, and must have been
built by the `rpm_repo_snapshot()` target, and installed via
`install_rpm_repo_snapshot()`.
