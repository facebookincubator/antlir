Shadow certain paths inside the container with other container paths, by
adding this to `plugins` kwarg of the `run_*` or `popen_*` functions:
  `ShadowPaths(shadow_paths)`

In practice, you will want `rpm_nspawn_plugins` instead.

One application of path shadowing is to (transiently) replace the system's
package manager with one that talks to our deterministic repo snaphot.

To allow in-place upgrades of the package managers, we set up shadow
copies that are compatible with the `LD_PRELOAD=librename_shadowed.so` hack.
