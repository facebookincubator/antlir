    ## What is this for?

    This class is to be a privilege / abstraction boundary that allows
    regular, unprivileged Python code to construct images.  Many btrfs
    ioctls require CAP_SYS_ADMIN (or some kind of analog -- e.g. a
    `libguestfs` VM or a privileged server for performing image operations).
    Furthermore, writes to the image-under-construction may require similar
    sorts of privileges to manipulate the image-under-construction as uid 0.

    One approach would be to eschew privilege boundaries, and to run the
    entire build process as `root`.  However, that would forever confine our
    build tool to be run in VMs and other tightly isolated contexts.  Since
    unprivileged image construction is technically possible, we will instead
    take the approach that -- as much as possible -- the build code runs
    unprivileged, as the repo-owning user, and only manipulates the
    filesystem-under-construction via this one class.

    For now, this means shelling out via `sudo`, but in the future,
    `libguestfs` or a privileged filesystem construction proxy could be
    swapped in with minimal changes to the overall structure.

    ## Usage

    - Think of `Subvol` as a ticket to operate on a btrfs subvolume that
      exists, or is about to be created, at a known path on disk. This
      convention lets us cleanly describe paths on a subvolume that does not
      yet physically exist.

    - Call the functions from the btrfs section to manage the subvolumes.

    - Call `subvol.run_as_root()` to use shell commands to manipulate the
      image under construction.

    - Call `subvol.path('image/relative/path')` to refer to paths inside the
      subvolume e.g. in arguments to the `subvol.run_*` functions.

        Overwrites `ouput_path` with a new btrfs image, and send this
        subvolume to this new volume.  The image is populated as a loopback
        mount, which will be unmounted before this function returns.

        Since btrfs sizing facilities are unreliable, we size the new
        filesystem by guesstimating the content size of the filesystem, and
        multiplying it by `waste_factor` to ensure that `receive` does not
        run out of space.  If out-of-space does occur, this function repeats
        multiply-send-receive until we succeed, so a low `waste_factor` can
        make image builds much slower.

        ## Notes on setting `waste_factor`

          - This is exposed for unit tests, you should probably not surface
            it to users.  We should improve the auto-sizing instead.

          - Even though sparse files make it fairly cheap to allocate a
            much larger loopback than what is required to contain the
            subvolume, we want to try to keep the loopback filesystem as
            full as possible. The primary rationale is that parts of
            our image distribution filesystem do not support sparse files
            (to be fixed). Secondarily, btrfs seems to increase the
            amount of overhead it permits itself as the base filesystem
            becomes larger. I have not carefully measured the loopback
            size after accounting for sparseness, but this needs to
            be tested before considering much larger waste factors.

          - While we resize down to `min-dev-size` after populating the
            volume, setting a higher waste factor is still not free.  The
            reason is that btrfs auto-allocates more metadata blocks for
            larger filesystems, but `resize` does not release them.  So if
            you start with a larger waste factor, your post-shrink
            filesystem will be larger, too.  This is one of the reasons why
            we should just `findmnt -o SIZE` to determine a safe size of the
            loopback (the other reason is below).

          - The default of 15% is very conservative, with the goal of
            never triggering an expensive send+receive combo. This seeks to
            optimize developer happiness.  In my tests, I have not seen a
            filesystem that needed more than 5%.  Later, we can add
            monitoring and gradually dial this down.

          - If your subvolume's `_estimate_content_bytes` is X, and it
            fits in a loopback of size Y, it is not guaranteed that you
            could have used `waste_factor = Y / X`, because lazy writes make
            it possible to resize a populated filesystem to have a size
            **below** what you would have needed to populate its content.

          - There is an alternative strategy to "multiply by waste_factor &
            re-send", which is to implement a `pv`-style function that
            sits on a pipe between `send` and `receive`, and does the
            following to make sure `receive` never runs out of space:
              - `btrfs filesystem sync`, `usage`, and if "min" free space
                drops too low, `resize`
              - `splice` (via `ctypes`, or write this interposition program
                in C) a chunk from `send` to `receive`. Using `splice`
                instead of copying through userspace is not **necessarily**
                essential, but in order to minimize latency, it's important
                that we starve the `receive` end as rarely as possible,
                which may require some degree of concurrency between reading
                from `send` and writing to `receive`.  To clarify: a naive
                Python prototype that read & wrote 2MB at a time -- a buffer
                that's large enough that we'd frequently starve `receive` or
                stall `send` -- experienced a 30% increase in wall time
                compared to `send | receive`.
              - Monitor usage much more frequently than the free space to
                chunk size ratio would indicate, since something may buffer.
                Don't use a growth increment that is TOO small.
              - Since there are no absolute guarantees that btrfs won't
                run out of space on `receive`, there should still be an
                outer retry layer, but it ought to never fire.
              - Be aware that the minimum `mkfs.brfs` size is 108MiB, the
                minimum size to which we can grow via `resize` is 175MiB,
                while the minimum size to which we can shrink via `resize`
                is 256MiB, so the early growth tactics should reflect this.

            The advantage of this strategy of interposing on a pipe, if
            implemented well, is that we should be able to achieve a smaller
            waste factor without paying occasionally doubling our wall clock
            and IOP costs due to retries.  The disadvantage is that if we do
            a lot of grow cycles prior to our shrink, the resulting
            filesystem may end up being more out-of-tune than if we had
            started with a large enough size from the beginning.

        """
        Returns a (usually) tight lower-bound guess of the filesystem size
        necessary to contain this subvolume.  The caller is responsible for
        appropriately padding this size when creating the destination FS.

        ## Future: Query the subvolume qgroup to estimate its size

          - If quotas are enabled, this should be an `O(1)` operation
            instead of the more costly filesystem tree traversal.  NB:
            qgroup size estimates tend to run a bit (~1%) lower than `du`,
            so growth factors may need a tweak.  `_estimate_content_bytes()`
            should `log.warning` and fall back to `du` if quotas are
            disabled in an older `buck-image-out`.  It's also an option to
            enable quotas and to trigger a `rescan -w`, but requires more
            code/testing.

          - Using qgroups for builds is a good stress test of the qgroup
            subsystem. It would help us gain confidence in that (a) they
            don't trigger overt issues (filesystem corruption, dramatic perf
            degradation, or crashes), and that (b) they report reasonably
            accurate numbers on I/O-stressed build hosts.

          - Should run an A/B test to see if the build perf wins of querying
            qgroups exceed the perf hit of having quotas enabled.

          - Eventually, we'd enable quotas by default for `buck-image-out`
            volumes.

          - Need to delete the qgroup whenever we delete a subvolume.  Two
            main cases: `Subvol.delete` and `subvolume_garbage_collector.py`.
            Can check if we are leaking cgroups by building & running &
            image tests, and looking to see if that leaves behind 0-sized
            cgroups unaffiliated with subvolumes.

          - The basic logic for qgroups looks like this:

            $ sudo btrfs subvol show buck-image-out/volume/example |
                grep 'Subvolume ID'
                    Subvolume ID:           1432

            $ sudo btrfs qgroup show --raw --sync buck-image-out/volume/ |
                grep ^0/1432
            0/1432     1381523456        16384
            # We want the second column, bytes in referenced extents.
