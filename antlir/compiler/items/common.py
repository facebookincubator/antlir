The classes produced by ImageItem are the various types of items that can be
installed into an image.  The compiler will verify that the specified items
have all of their requirements satisfied, and will then apply them in
dependency order.

To understand how the methods `provides()` and `requires()` affect
dependency resolution / installation order, start with the docblock at the
top of `provides.py`.

    """
    With respect to ordering, there are two types of operations that the
    image compiler performs against images.

    (1) Regular additive operations are naturally ordered with respect to
        one another by filesystem dependencies.  For example: we must create
        /usr/bin **BEFORE** copying `:your-tool` there.

    (2) Everything else, including:
         - RPM installation, which has a complex internal ordering, but
           simply needs needs a definitive placement as a block of `yum`
           operations -- due to `yum`'s complexity & various scripts, it's
           not desirable to treat installs as regular additive operations.
         - Path removals.  It is simplest to perform them in bulk, without
           interleaving with other operations.  Removals have a natural
           ordering with respect to each other -- child before parent, to
           avoid tripping "must_exist" unnecessarily.

    For the operations in (2), this class sets a justifiable deteriminstic
    ordering for black-box blocks of operations, and assumes that each
    individual block's implementation will order its internals sensibly.

    Phases will be executed in the order listed here.

    The operations in (1) are validated, dependency-sorted, and built after
    all of the phases have built.

    IMPORTANT: A new phase implementation MUST:
      - handle pre-existing protected paths via `_protected_path_set`
      - emit `ProvidesDoNotAccess` if it provides new protected paths
      - ensure that `_protected_path_set` in future phases knows how to
        discover these protected paths by inspecting the filesystem.
    See `ParentLayerItem`, `RemovePathsItem`, and `MountItem` for examples.

    Future: the complexity around protected paths is a symptom of a lack of
    a strong runtime abstraction.  Specifically, if `Subvol.run_as_root`
    used mount namespaces and read-only bind mounts to enforce protected
    paths (as is done today in `yum-dnf-from-snapshot`), then it would not
    be necessary for the compiler to know about them.

    #     TARGETS file -- that would make it more laborious to change the
    #     compression format for tarballs, e.g.  Instead, the generator
    #     prints the name of the created file to stdout.  This does not
    #     introduce nondeterminism for current consumers of `image.source`:
    #       - A tarball name cannot affect the result of its extraction.
    #       - `yum` ignores the RPM name, and reads metadata from its content.
    #       - `install_file` specifies the destination filename in `TARGETS`.

    #     would not be far-fetched, this approach just seemed cleaner.
