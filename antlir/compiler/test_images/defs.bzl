#
# Why do we need these shims?
#
# `_assert_package` in `oss_shim_impl.bzl` deliberately treats
# `compiler/test_images` as being outside of the Antlir codebase.
#
# This allows our collection of test images to validate that the Antlir
# user-instantiatable API is properly annotated with `antlir_rule` kwargs.
#
# However, this also means that we cannot directly use Buck rules as
# provided by `oss_shim.bzl` inside `test_images`.  But all of these rule
# invocations still need to go through `oss_shim.bzl` for FB/OSS
# compatibility.
#
# So, we shim the shim for the few rules that `test_images` rely on.  For
# these shimmed rules, `ANTLIR_RULE_TEST = "user-internal"` was picked
# arbitrarily -- "user-facing" would be fine too.  Internal seemed slightly
# preferable since it would expand CI coverage of Antlir changes.
#

ANTLIR_RULE_TEST = "user-internal"  # Explained above
