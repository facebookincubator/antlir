# This could be made to run against `make_demo_sendstreams`, which would
# (redundantly with `btrfs_diff` tests) build a send-stream from scratch
# instead of using a committed one.  However, this would be fidgety since
# I'd have to pass a repo path here, which is hard in @mode/opt -- I'd need
# to pass it in from a unit-test PAR (which gets run in-tree).  On the other
# hand, the coverage benefit of doing the work is not that great, since we
# will receive & send this stream with live btrfs, anyway.
