# By using the api directly, we can handle errors much more reasonably (instead
# of, to name a totally reasonable operation of dnf, silently ignoring packages
# that don't exist)

# NOTE: this must be run with system python, so cannot be a PAR file
# /usr/bin/dnf itself uses /usr/libexec/platform-python, so by using that we can
