    Copies a subtree of an existing layer into the one under construction. To
    the extent possible, filesystem metadata are preserved.


    ### Trailing slashes on both paths are significant

    The three supported cases are:
    - `s/rc` -> `dest/` creates `dest/rc`
    - `s/rc/` -> `dest/` creates `dest/(children of rc)`
    - `s/rc` -> `dest` creates `dest`

    More explicitly:
    - A trailing slash in `src_path` means "use the `rsync` convention":
        * Do not clone the source directory, but only its contents.
        * `dest_path` must be a pre-existing dir, and it must end in `/`
    - A trailing slash in `dst_path` means that it's a
        pre-existing directory (e.g.  made by `ensure_dirs_exist`), and
        `clone` will only write to:
        * `dst/(basename of src_path)` if `src_path` lacks a trailing `/`
        * `dst/(children of src_path)` if `src_path` has a trailing `/`

    ### Known deviations from perfect cloning

    Most likely, SELinux attrs change.

    ### UID/GID remapping

    `src_layer` and the destination layer must have the same user/group _names_
    available, but those names do not need to map to the same ids. uid/gids will
    be remapped to the appropriate numeric id of that user/group in the
    destination layer.

    ### When to use this?

    Often, instead of using this, you should prefer
    [`layer_mount`](#featurelayer_mount), which allows you to compose
    independent pieces of the filesystem at *runtime*, without incurring the
    cost of publishing images with a lot of duplicated content.

    If you're trying to copy the output of a regular Buck target, instead use
    [`feature.install`](#featureinstall).

    Args:
        src_layer: Buck target pointing to source `image.layer`.

            This image must contain the contents to be cloned

        src_path: Root path to clone from in `src_layer`
        dst_path: Root path to clone into in the layer being built
        user: Set owning user on all files and directories

            If not set, the same username is used between `src_layer` and the
            layer being built

        group: Set owning group on all files and directories

            If not set, the same group name is used between `src_layer` and the
            layer being built
