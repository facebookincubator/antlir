"""
Usage:

    python3 -m btrfs_diff.examples.sendstream_has_loop_device < sendstream ||
        echo No loop or loop-control

Reads a send-stream from stdin, prints to stdout the major & minor of the
first loop or loop-control device found, and returns 0.

Returns 2 if no loops exist, 1 on usage or data errors.

            # process a sequence of send-streams in dependency order (or
            # we'd hit dependency errors), whereas just scanning the
            # send-stream is cheap.
            #
            # There are a couple of other approaches to getting the path:
            #  -  Roll some special logic for resolving what names
            #     send-stream temporaries ultimately map to.  Probably not
            #     worth it.
            #  -  Add the capability to `Subvolume` to apply items even when
            #     the dependency is not there, and instead to record some
            #     kind of placeholder / dependency object in the tree.  The
            #     semantics would take some thought to get right, but the
            #     upside is significant, since we would then be able to
            #     handle filesystem diffs almost as easily as full
            #     filesystems.
