Usage:

    alias demo_sendstream='python3 -m btrfs_diff.tests.gold_demo_sendstreams'
    demo_sendstream create_ops | python3 -m btrfs_diff.examples.dump_sendstream

Reads a send-stream from stdin, prints the Python parse to stdout. This
output is only meant for human consumption -- but it would be easy to
instead serialize each item to something parseable like JSON.

Besides providing a code example, the main advantage of this program
compared to `btrfs receive --dump` is that our parsing & output has no known
bugs, and is backed by through test coverage.  Read the heading of
`parse_dump.py` for the known bugs in `--dump`.
