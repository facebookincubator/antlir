    """
    If you have a test that builds up some complex object (e.g. `InodeIDMap`,
    `Subvolume`) by following a script, you can use this utility to make
    your test also check that your object is correctly `deepcopy`able.

    To start, you will inject `obj = yield 'step name', obj` throughout your
    test script.
     - Each `yield` point needs a unique name for safety & debuggability.
     - Be sure to keep the set of `yield` points the same, no matter how
       many times your test script runs.

    Then, call `self.check_deepcopy_at_each_step(self.your_test_script)`.

    This will invoke your test script numerous times, `deepcopy`ing the
    object at each of the steps to check that your test script succeeds even
    if it's operating on a copy.  After `deepcopy`-based run, your test
    script will also run with the original object swapped back in at the
    same step.  This ensures that the mutations on the copy did not affect
    the original.

    There are limits to this test -- it only verifies `deepcopy` safety with
    respect to the operations that you perform.  It is very easy to miss
    subtle object aliasing issues in a simple unit-test.  Therefore, this
    test is not a substitute for systematically reasoning about whether each
    part of your object is correctly `deepcopy`able.
