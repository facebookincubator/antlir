"""
Prints a pickled dict of test data to stdout. As a binary, does NOT work
in @mode/opt -- in that role, it's just a development tool.

The intent of this script is to exercise all the send-stream command types
that can be emitted by `btrfs send`.

After running from inside the per-Buck-repo btrfs volume,
`test_parse_dump.py` and `test_parse_send_stream.py` compare the parsed
output to what we expect on the basis of this script.

For usage, `buck run antlir/btrfs_diff:make-demo-sendstreams -- --help`.

## Updating this script's gold output

Run this:

  buck run antlir/btrfs_diff:make-demo-sendstreams -- \\
    --write-gold-to-dir antlir/btrfs_diff/tests/

You will then need to manually update `uuid_create` and related fields in
the "expected" section of the test.

In addition to parsing the gold output, `test_parse_dump.py` also checks
that we are able to parse the output of a **live** `btrfs receive --dump`.
Unfortunately, we are not able to check the **correctness** of these live
parses.  This is because the specific sequence of lines that `btrfs send`
produces to represent the filesystem is an implementation detail without a
_uniquely_ correct output, which may change over time.

Besides testing that parsing does not crash on a live `make_demo_sendstreams`,
whose output may even vary from host-to-host, we do two things:

 - Via this script, we freeze a sequence from one point in time just for the
   sake of having a parse-only test.

 - To test the semantics of the parsed data, we test applying a freshly
   generated sendstream to a mock filesystem, which should always give the
   same result, regardless of the specific send-stream commands used.
