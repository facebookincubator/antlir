This is an analog of `copy.deepcopy`, with the caveat that `freeze` returns
a recursively immutable copy of its argument.  This is achieved by replacing
mutable containers by immutable ones (including all the built-ins, plus
`NamedTuple`) after `freeze`ing every item.  If an object provides the
method `freeze(self, *, _memo, ...)`, we call that instead, and use its
return value.

Analogously to `deepcopy`, the `_memo` keyword argument is used to correctly
copy multiple references to the same object. Unlike `deepcopy`, we make no
provisions for `freeze`ing self-referential structures, because it is
impossible to construct a recursively immutable structure that references
itself.

Future: Once `deepfrozen` is landed, this sort of thing should get nicer.
