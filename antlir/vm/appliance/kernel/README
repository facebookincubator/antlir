Ideally this kernel would be produced by a proper buck target, but until that
is possible in a reasonable manner, here are some details about where this
vmlinuz came from:

- git tag v5.7 of the linux kernel (linus-upstream branch if in FB)
- ./config used as .config

But why?

This kernel is checked in here to serve the purpose of having a suitably
small and fast to boot kernel that is reasonable to use in an ephemeral VM.
It requires no modules, and only contains the minimal amount of features to
boot in QEMU and speak to the host with a virtio nic.
This kernel must be publicly available to be able to use it in the OSS
version of Antlir. We might also want to use more aggressively up-to-date
upstream kernel versions than FB in general, since this is a constrained
environment and we might want to make use of new kernel features (for
example, virtio sockets).
