vmtest is a framework to run `{cpp,rust,python}_unittest`s inside a
transparent VM.

<FbInternalOnly>
vmtest is commonly used for writing kernel-specific tests in fbcode There
exists the need to test kernel features in certain fbcode projects like
Tupperware Agent. vmtest is a way to write any unittest in fbcode and have it
be executed on multiple different production kernels at once.

To test across different kernels in fbcode, look at
`kernel/kernels/kernels.bzl` for the kernel version selection filters
available, so you don't have to maintain a static list of kernels on which to
run your test.

There are usage examples for each supported language in antlir/vm/tests.

## Implementation Details
### Root FS
A root filesystem image is built with Antlir and packaged as a BTRFS loopback
device setup as a seed device.
QEMU is started with two disks: the readonly Antlir-built image and a rw disk
that is thrown away after the VM shuts down.

### Guest connection
The VM is started with a virtio-net tap device, and configures a link-local
IPv6 address. vmtest then controls the guest by connecting to sshd running
inside the virtual machine.

### Guest->host boot notification
To make the SSH connection more reliable, the guest VM is configured to write
to a virtio-serial port when it is ready for a connection from the host.
