title: Profiling the Compiler
---

## Why

Profiling the Antlir compiler is very important for being able to make targeted
performance improvements, as well as being able to prove performance
gains/regressions.

## Getting profiler data

The Antlir compiler respects an env var `ANTLIR_PROFILE`.
When `ANTLIR_PROFILE` is set to a directory path, the compiler will write out a
Python pstat file from `cProfile` for each image target.

```s
$ ANTLIR_PROFILE=/home/antliruser/prof buck build //my/image:target
$ ls /home/antliruser/prof
my_image:target.pstat
```

## Viewing profiler data

There are a variety of things you can do with pstat files, but the easiest is
probably to load it in [snakeviz](https://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/).

```s
$ buck run //antlir/third-party/facebook:snakeviz -- -h $HOSTNAME -s /home/antliruser/my_image:target.pstat
```

```s
$ snakeviz /home/antliruser/my_image:target.pstat
```

</OssOnly>

This will print out a URL that you can visit in your browser to get an
explorable icicle graph.

## Caveats

This doesn't give a completely accurate representation of actual wall-clock time
spent in the compiler. Normal operation of the compiler will run parallelizable
`ImageItem`s in threads, but profiling mutlithreaded programs is not well
supported by cProfile, so threading is disabled when `ANTLIR_PROFILE` is set.
The resulting profile data thus does not adequately show which steps the
compiler would normally take in parallel, but it does still show accurate
timings for the individual actions.
