# Test Runner

Antlir ships with a [buck external test
runner](https://buck.build/files-and-dirs/buckconfig.html#test.external_runner)
that will soon become the default runner when `buck test` is invoked.

This offers a number of features over the internal runner, including
configurable retries, automatically ignoring disabled tests and more
configurable parallel execution of individual test cases.

## Implementation

The test runner is implemented with a rust binary located in
`tools/testinfra/runner`. It is currently capable of running Python and Rust
unit tests, and outputting a mostly-JUnit-compatible XML file reporting the
results.

## CI Integration

The external runner is still under development, so it is not yet the default
test runner for the repo, but instead is launched as a secondary GitHub Actions
workflow until it has feature parity with the internal test runner (mainly
pretty HTML reports on workflow runs)

## Future Features
- Automatic disabling of failing tests
- Pretty HTML reports
