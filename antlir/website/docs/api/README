This directory is for auto-generated documentation files that are parsed
directly from the .bzl files in antlir/bzl

The generation happens at docs site build time via `yarn build`.

Non-generated files should be placed elsewhere, as the contents of this
directory are ignored by default, so that generated docs do not have to be
committed to source control.
