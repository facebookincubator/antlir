## Introduction to RPM

The web has ample documentation on the [RedHat Package Manager ecosystem](
https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/how-manage-packages), so Antlir RPM docs
focus on Antlir-specific terminology and behaviors.

To follow these docs, you'll want to be familiar with the following
standard terms:
  - **Package**: An archive file containing the files to be installed into
    the OS + package manager metadata, including a list of dependencies.
  - **NEVRA**: Name-Epoch-Version-Release-Architecture -- a unique ID for a
    package within a "universe" (Antlir-specific, defined below).
    The content of a NEVRA *should* be immutable (within a universe).

    Importantly, package managers define an old-to-new ordering on EVRAs,
    and OS management tools typically try to upgrade to the newest package
    available.

    Sometimes multiple packages share EVRA schemes, and even require
    matching EVRAs across different package names -- see "package group"
    below.

  - **Repo**: Short for "repository" -- a collection of packages, plus a set
    of indexes called **repodata** (as XML or Sqlite databases) computed
    from those packages.  Typically hosted at an HTTP URL.  The root of the
    repo is `repomd.xml`, which links to everything else.

    A repo's content may change, as packages are added and removed.  As they
    evolve, repos generally attempt to maintain some kind of backwards
    compatibility / upgrade path -- e.g.  CentOS8.1 should be upgradable to
    CentOS8.2 and so forth.  Not all repos have discrete point releases --
    e.g.  EPEL7 just moves forward continuously.

    Note that the same package instance (or package name) can be contained
    in multiple repos, and the package manager will somehow pick one
    (implementation-defined behavior).  Therefore, it is important that
    repos that are being used together be mutually compatible.
  - **Distro release**: A collection of mutually compatible repositories. For
    example, CentOS7.2 is a distro comprising multiple "standard" repos,
    while EPEL7 is an add-on repository intended to be compatible with
    all CentOS7.x distros.
  - **yum** / **dnf**: The package manager program, which installs packages
    and their dependencies into a filesystem root.
  - **{yum,dnf}.conf**: Configuration for the package manager, including a
    list of repos, plus install-time settings, like whether to install
    optional dependencies, or to validate package GPG signatures.


## Key concepts

### Universe

An RPM-based operating system is typically built from a collection of
mutually compatible repos.  In Antlir, each repo is assigned a **universe**
name, which indicates the intended scope of mutual compatibility of packages
within that repo.

An OS may included repos may be larger than a single distro release, e.g.
it is possible to have a structure like this:
  - CentOS8.3 -- universe "centos8"
  - EPEL8 -- universe "centos8"
  - CentOS9Stream -- universe "centos9"
  - CompanyInternalRepo -- universe "company", statically linked, installed
    in `/opt/company`.

Key invariants for universes:
  - All repos in a universe are mutually compatible.
  - Additionally, some universes may also be mutally compatible. In the
    example above, "centos8" and "centos9" are **not** mutually compatible.
    However, it is very reasonable for both "centos8" and "centos9" to be
    compatible with "company".
  - For all repos in a universe, a package name must refer to the same
    piece of software (i.e. it must be upgradable).
  - Within a universe, a package NEVRA must uniquely identify the byte
    contents of the package.  Caveat: if package re-signing is commonplace,
    we may consider supporting an exemption in Antlir for ignoring
    the signature when the package contents are otherwise identical.

### Package group

Within a universe, a list of related packages, all of which must always have
the same installed version (and ought to be installed in one transaction).
For example, `systemd`, `systemd-libs`, and `systemd-devel` must be in sync.
Each package may be in at most one package group.

### Repo snapshot

Given a collection of repos from mutually compatible universes, Antlir
has code (see `antlir/rpm/snapshot_repos.py`) to:
  - Given a `{yum,dnf}.conf}, download each repo (atomically within a repo,
    but not across repos).
  - Save the packages and repodata to append-only storage. This step
    uses a database (`antlir/rpm/repo_db.py`) to avoid redundantly storing
    objects that were already captured by a previous snapshot.
  - Save a build-time index of all the packages in all the repos,
    called a `RepoSnapshot` (`antlir/rpm/repo_snapshot.py`). This is
    serialized to SQLite and also uploaded to append-only storage.
  - Run `nspawn_in_subvol` containers, which are able to
    **deterministically** install RPMs from a `RepoSnapshot`.  This is
    normally arranged by committing to source control:
      - The storage ID of the `RepoSnapshot`
      - `{yum,dnf}.conf` corresponding to the snapshot
      - Trusted GPG keys
