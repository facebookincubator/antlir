## Stable Flavors

`REPO_CFG.stable_flavors` defines which flavors of rpms are included
by default into layers that determine their flavor from the parent
```
REPO_CFG = {
    "stable_flavors": [
        "centos7",
        "centos8",
    ]
}

image.layer(
    name = "test-layer",
    parent = "parent-layer",
    features = [
        image.rpms_install([
            # Includes `centos7/gtk`, `centos8/gtk`
            # but not `centos7-untested/gtk` or `centos8-untested/gtk`
            "gtk",
        ])
    ]
)
```
Flavors not included in `REPO_CFG.stable_flavors` are considered unstable,
and can have incorrect rpm snapshots that do not include rpms.

We cannot include rpms from unstable flavors by default into layers
with inherited flavors. This a failing snapshot would cause a
missing dependency for all layers with inherited flavors and break their build.

Instead, if a user wants to install an rpm onto a layer with an
unstable flavor, they have to explicitly mark the flavor with
```
image.layer(
    name = "test-layer",
    features = [
        # Correct installation of flavors with error annotation.
        image.rpms_install([
            "gtk",
        ], flavors = [
            "centos8-untested",
        ]),
    ]
    flavor = "centos8-untested",
)
```
This ensures when an rpm snapshot fails, we only break layers of
that specific flavor.

## Restrictions on `rpms_install`

We also have a restriction that when using an unstable flavor, the rpm
action must include the flavor.

This is to make it clear to the user that unflavored rpm actions only
affect layers with a stable flavor. They do not affect layers with
an unstable flavor.

```
image.layer(
    name = "test-layer",
    features = [
        # Throws an error because it does not contain
        # the rpm for the untested flavor `centos8-untested`
        image.rpms_install([
            "gtk",
        ]),
    ]
    flavor = "centos8-untested",
)
```
