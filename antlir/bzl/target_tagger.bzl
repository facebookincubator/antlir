"""
Our continuous integration system might run different build steps in
different sandboxes, so the intermediate outputs of `feature`s
must be cacheable by Buck.  In particular, they must not contain
absolute paths to targets.

However, to build a dependent `image_layer`, we will need to invoke the
image compiler with the absolute paths of the outputs that will comprise
the image.

Therefore, we need to (a) record all the targets, for which the image
compiler will need absolute paths, and (b) resolve them only in the
build step that invokes the compiler.

This tagging scheme makes it possible to find ALL such targets in the
output of `feature` targets by simply traversing the JSON structure.  This
seems more flexible and less messy than maintaining a look-aside list of
targets whose paths the `image_layer` converter would need to resolve.
