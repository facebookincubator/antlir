We want to be able to use packages of files, fetched from an external data
store, for in-repo builds. Conceptually, this is pretty simple:
  - The repo stores an address and a cryptographic hash of the package.
  - There's a build target that fetches the package, checks the hash, and
    presents the package contents as an `image.layer`.

The above process is repo-hermetic (unless the package is unavailable), and
lets repo builds use pre-built artifacts. Such artifacts bring two benefits:
  - Speed: we can explicitly cache large, infrequently changed artifacts.
  - Controlled API churn: I may want to use a "stable" version of my
    dependency, rather than whatever I might build off trunk.

The details of "how to fetch a package" will vary depending on the package
store. This is abstracted by `_PackageFetcherInfo` below.

The glue code in this file specifies a uniform way of exposing package
stores as Buck targets. Its opinions are, roughly:

  - The data store has many versions of the package, each one immutable.
    New versions keep getting added.  However, a repo checkout may only
    access some fixed versions of a package via "tags".  Each (package, tag)
    pair results in a completely repo-deterministic `image.layer`.

  - In the repo, a (package, tag) pair is an `image.layer` target in a
    centralized repo location.

  - The layer's mount info has a correctly populated `runtime_source`, so if
    another layer mounts it at build-time, then this mount can be replicated
    at runtime.

  - One representation is provided for the in-repo package database:
    merge-conflict-free "json dir".  Aside: we used to have a "db.bzl"
    format, which was cheaper at Buck parse-time, but prone to merge
    conflicts.  We abandoned it.  In contrast, the "json dir" DB format is
    free of merge conflicts, so long as each package-tag pair is only update
    by one actor.

You can use a DB by putting something like the below in a Buck file.  Prefer
to put this in a separate directory that will NOT get built by humans
running `buck build project/...` or by CI, since fetching all packages on
every build is a potentially expensive, and definitely wasteful, operation.

    # In `pkg/pkg.bzl` --

    def _fetched_layer(name, tag = "stable"):
        return "//pkg/db:" + name + "/" + tag + "-USE-pkg.fetched_layer"
    pkg = struct(fetched_layer = _fetched_layer)

    # In `pkg/db/package_name/tag_name.json` --

    # Two MANDATORY lines of comments on how to update this file.
    # At FB, this points at the internal "update package DB" script.
    {"address": ..., "hash", ...}

    # In `pkg/db/TARGETS` --

    fetched_package_layers_from_json_dir_db(
        fetcher = {
            "extra_deps": ["`image.source` "generator" to download package"],
            "fetch_package": "writes `tarball`/`install_files` JSON to stdout",
            "print_mount_config": "adds package address to `runtime_source`",
        },
        package_db_dir = "db/",
        layer_suffix = "-USE-pkg.fetched_layer",
        # For some advanced use-cases, you may want to also specify
        # `nondeterministic_fs_metadata_suffix`, see its inline docs.
    )

Now you can refer to a stable version of a package, represented as an
`image.layer`, via `pkg.fetched_layer("name")`.
