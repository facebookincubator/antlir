# Here are the ways to specify a snapshot:
#
#  - An /__antlir__ path that's valid in the container.  This is mainly used
#    like so: `RPM_DEFAULT_SNAPSHOT_FOR_INSTALLER_DIR + "/prog"`.
#
#  - A Buck target path.  But, it is **not** used to depend on a Buck
#    target.  A target may not even exist in the current repo at this path.
#    Rather, this target path is normalized, mangled, and then used to
#    select a non-default child of `/__antlir__/rpm/repo-snapshot/` in the
#    build appliance.  So this refers to a target that got incorporated into
#    the build appliance, whenever that image was built.
#
# KEEP THE `mangle_target` PART IN SYNC with its copy in `rpm/find_snapshot.py`
