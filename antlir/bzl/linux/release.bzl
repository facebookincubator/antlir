             help solve that core problem, but another approach is to support
             the generation of this file directly in the Compiler itself.

    `os_name`: Populates the NAME key and `os_name.lower()` populates the ID key.
    `variant`: Populates the VARIANT key and `variant.lower()` populates the VARIANT_ID key.
