        # reason we allow it for `source` and `layer` is that it's at least
        # plausible that other parts of those targets' output get used
        # elsewhere.  In contrast, a generator's output is ephemeral to a

        # script's contract is:
        #   - Its arguments are the strings from `generator_args`, followed
        #     by one last argument that is a path to an `image.layer`-
        #     provided temporary directory, into which the generator must
        #     write its file.
        #   - The generator must print the filename of its output, followed
        #     by a single newline, to stdout.  The filename MUST be relative
        #     to the provided temporary directory.
        #   - The file's contents must match `content_hash`, see below.
        #
        # In deciding between `source` / `layer` and `generator`, you are
        # trading off disk space in the Buck cache for the resources (e.g.
        # latency, CPU usage, or network usage) needed to re-generate the
        # file.  For example, using `generator*` is a good choice when it
        # simply performs a download from a fast immutable blob store.

        # Note that a single script can potentially be used both as a
        # generator, and to produce cached artifacts, see how the compiler
        # test `TARGETS` uses `hello_world_tar_generator.sh` in a genrule.

        #   - It's probably reasonable for this to also be able to output
        #     a directory instead of a file. Support this when needed.

        #     of a generator if it occurs multiple times within a single
