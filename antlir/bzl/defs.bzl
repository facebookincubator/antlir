    This rule does not build anything useful! Its only job is to inform
    `buck query`-powered dependency resolvers that `image_*` targets depend
    on the underlying macros.

    Without these rules, we would not automatically trigger the appropriate
    builds & tests on changes to the macro code, which would make it easy to
    accidentally break trunk.

    This should eventually become unnecessary, follow Q10141.

    Future: It'd be great to enforce that `deps` can only refer to rules of
    type `fake_macro_library`.  I'm not sure how to do that without writing
    a full-fledged converter, though.
