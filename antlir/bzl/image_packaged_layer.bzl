`image.packaged_layer` is a small wrapper around `image.layer` to support both
creating a layer and including a reference to a corresponding 'publisher' target
within that layer, which is then responsible for publishing that layer as a
squashfs package to an external artifact store.

Args:

    layer_name: Target name that will be given to `partial_layer`.

    publisher_name: Target name that will be given to `partial_publisher`.

    partial_layer: A partial `image.layer` object that will be supplied with a
        custom `mount_config` and located under `name`.

    partial_publisher: A partial target supporting a `path_actions` argument,
        which will be provided by the implementation. When run, this target
        should publish the targets in `path_actions` to an artifact store.
