    # This outer "test" is not a test at all, but a wrapper that passes
    # arguments to the inner test binary.  It is a `python_unittest` since:
    #
    #  - That invokes the "pyunit" test runner, which is required to
    #    correctly interact with the inner test.
    #
    #  - It is **also** possible to use `sh_test` either with
    #    `type = "pyunit"` or with a tag of `custom-type-pyunit` to trigger
    #    the "pyunit" test runner.  However, Buck does not support the
    #    `needed_coverage` argument on `sh_test`, so this seemingly
    #    language-independent approach would break some important test
    #    features.
    #
    # Future: See Q18889 for an attempt to convince the Buck team to allow
    # `sh_test` to supply all the special testing arguments that other tests
    # use, like `needed_coverage`, `additional_coverage_targets`, and maybe
    # a few others.  This should not be a big deal, since Buck passes all
    # that data to the test runner as JSON, and lets it handle the details.
    # Then, we could plausibly have the same `sh_test` logic for all
    # languages.
    #
    # Future: It may be useful to also set `needed_coverage` on the inner
    # test, search for `_get_par_build_args` in the fbcode macros.
