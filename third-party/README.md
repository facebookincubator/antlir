## Third-party Libraries

Here are defined the set of needed libraries that come from external sources, hence the name
`third-party`.  They are organized by `platform` where platform currently consists of 3 things:

### `bazel-skylib`
This contains a set of `starlark` macros used by this tool.  This is a `git submodule` that resolves
to a specific hash.  It's best to leave this alone.

### `fedora33`

This contains binaries/libraries provided as part of `fedora33` that are packaged as `rpm` files.
Adding or updating libraries here is currently a manual process.  Talk to @zeroxoneb if you need to
add or change this list.

### `python`

This contains python3 libraries that are provided the default `pypi` repositories.  Only `python3`
is supported.  Adding or updating libraries here is currently a manual process.  Talk to @vmagro
if you need to modify anything here.

### `rust`

Rust crates are referenced by `rust/BUCK`, which is autogenerated by running a
`buck query` internally. It is not currently possible to (automatically) add a
new crate dependency in an OSS PR. Ask @vmagro to add a dependency, or try to
add a handwritten target for your new dep.

Inside Facebook, run:
```
$ buck run //antlir/public_tld/third-party/rust/facebook:fixup-rust-deps >!
    ~/fbcode/antlir/public_tld/third-party/rust/BUCK
```
to update the generated `BUCK` file. This will automatically query the used
dependencies of all the buck targets under `antlir/`
